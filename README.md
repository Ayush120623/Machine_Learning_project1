Predicting Heart Attacks with Machine Learning ❤️🩺
Just wrapped up an exciting project where I built a Machine Learning model to predict if someone is prone to a heart attack using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression! 🔍📊
Using a structured dataset containing key health indicators like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits, I trained and compared both models to see which one performed better in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
Key Takeaways:
 ✅ Decision Tree: Great for understanding feature importance and visualizing decision paths.
 ✅ Logistic Regression: Works well for binary classification with clear probability estimates.
 ✅ Data Matters! Feature engineering and cleaning played a crucial role in improving predictions.
This project reinforced the power of AI in healthcare analytics, potentially aiding early diagnosis and preventive care.
Would love to hear your thoughts! How do you see ML impacting the future of preventive healthcare? Let's discuss!
